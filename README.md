# Zendro

Zendro is a software tool to quickly create a data warehouse tailored to your specifications. You tell Zendro what the structure of your data is, in the form of models, and where the data is or shall be stored. Zendro will then automatically create two standardized interfaces for your data models. Both interfaces provide access to the standard CRUD, create, read, update, and delete functions, available for each of the defined data models. One of the two interfaces is an intuitive graphical browser based single page application implemented in Google's standard material design. The other is an exhaustive application programming interface built with Facebook's efficient GraphQL framework, enabling a connection to your data warehouse from any programming language or data analysis pipeline with utmost ease, simply by sending HTTP requests to your GraphQL server. Data can be distributed over several databases and servers without losing the relationships between your data records, even if they are not stored in the same place.

Zendro consists of two main components, backend and frontend. The backend component has its [base project](https://github.com/ScienceDb/graphql-server) and a [code generator](https://github.com/ScienceDb/graphql-server-model-codegen). The frontend of SPA (Single Page Application) also has its [base project](https://github.com/ScienceDb/single-page-app) and a [code generator](https://github.com/ScienceDb/single-page-app-codegen).
See the guides below on how to use Zendro.

### CONTRIBUTIONS
Zendro is the product of a joint effort between the Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany and the Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad, México, to generate a tool that allows efficiently building data warehouses capable of dealing with diverse data generated by different research groups in the context of the FAIR principles and multidisciplinary projects. The name Zendro comes from the words Zenzontle and Drossel, which are Mexican and German words denoting a mockingbird, a bird capable of “talking” different languages, similar to how Zendro can connect your data warehouse from any programming language or data analysis pipeline.

#### Zendro author contributions
Asis Hallab and Alicia Mastretta-Yanes coordinated the project. Asis Hallab designed the software. Programming of code generators, the browser based single page application interface, and the GraphQL application programming interface was done by Katja Dohm, Constantin Eiteneuer, Francisco Ramírez, Tim Rehberg, Veronica Suaste, David Velasco, Thomas Voecking, and Dan Wang. Counselling and use case definitions were contributed by Francisca Acevedo, Vicente Arriaga, Frank Fischer, Roland Pieruschka, Alejandro Ponce, Irene Ramos, and Björn Usadel. User experience and application of Zendro on data management projects was carried out by Asis Hallab, Alicia Mastretta-Yanes, Yaxal Ponce, Irene Ramos, Verónica Suaste, and David Velasco. Logo design was made by Bernardo Terroba.
