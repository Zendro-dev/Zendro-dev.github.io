# Zendro

Zendro is a software tool to quickly create a data warehouse tailored to your specifications. You tell Zendro what the structure of your data is, in the form of models, and where the data is or shall be stored. Zendro will then automatically create two standardized interfaces for your data models. Both interfaces provide access to the standard CRUD, create, read, update, and delete functions, available for each of the defined data models. One of the two interfaces is an intuitive graphical browser based single page application implemented in Google's standard material design. The other is an exhaustive application programming interface built with Facebook's efficient GraphQL framework, enabling a connection to your data warehouse from any programming language or data analysis pipeline with utmost ease, simply by sending HTTP requests to your GraphQL server. Data can be distributed over several databases and servers without losing the relationships between your data records, even if they are not stored in the same place.

Zendro consists of two main components, backend and frontend. The backend component has its [base project](https://github.com/ScienceDb/graphql-server) and a [code generator](https://github.com/ScienceDb/graphql-server-model-codegen). The frontend of SPA (Single Page Application) also has its [base project](https://github.com/ScienceDb/single-page-app) and a [code generator](https://github.com/ScienceDb/single-page-app-codegen).
See the guides below on how to use Zendro.

## SHOW ME HOW IT LOOKS!

Would you like to see Zendro in action before deciding to learn more? That's fine! We set up a Dummy Zendro Instance for you to explore [Zendro's graphical user interface]( https://zendro.conabio.gob.mx/spa) and [Zendro's API]( https://zendro.conabio.gob.mx/graphiql). The tutorials on how to [use Zendro day to day](#using-zendro-day-to-day) of the section below use this instance, so go there to start exploring.


## HOW-TO GUIDES:

### Installation and sysadmin

To start trying Zendro you can try the [Quickstart tutorial](https://zendro-dev.github.io/quickstart.html) on how to create a new Zendro project with pre-defined datamodels, database and environment variables. Then you can try the [Getting started tutorial](https://zendro-dev.github.io/setup_root.html), a step-by-step guide on how to create a new Zendro project from scratch, aimed at software developers and system administrators.

# CONTRIBUTIONS
Zendro is the product of a joint effort between the Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany and the Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad, México, to generate a tool that allows efficiently building data warehouses capable of dealing with diverse data generated by different research groups in the context of the FAIR principles and multidisciplinary projects. The name Zendro comes from the words Zenzontle and Drossel, which are Mexican and German words denoting a mockingbird, a bird capable of “talking” different languages, similar to how Zendro can connect your data warehouse from any programming language or data analysis pipeline.
